## üîó Live Demo

Check out the live application [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/qShihab/Movie-Recommendation-System)  
> The app is deployed on **Hugging Face Spaces**, providing a seamless user experience without installation.

## Must requirement (must read)
- Due to very large size I was unable to upload the datasets and the `similarity.joblib` file.  
- You can download those files from the Google Drive link below.
  Download the files from [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/qShihab/Movie-Recommendation-System](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oGEX1hWysly4Ww2QujIS4adhvGebfKy8/view?usp=sharing)  
- To run this code on Streamlit use:  
  ```bash
  python -m streamlit run app.py

## üìù Technologies Used

This project leverages modern Python libraries and frameworks to deliver a fast, interactive, and visually appealing movie recommendation system.  

- **Python 3.x** ‚Äì Core programming language for backend logic and data processing.  
- **Streamlit** ‚Äì Web framework for building an interactive, user-friendly app interface.  
- **Pandas** ‚Äì Data manipulation and preprocessing, including cleaning and organizing movie datasets.  
- **Pickle** ‚Äì Efficient storage and retrieval of preprocessed datasets, such as similarity matrices.  
- **Requests** ‚Äì Handles API calls to **TMDB** to fetch movie posters and additional metadata dynamically.  
- **Scikit-learn** ‚Äì Provides tools to compute similarity metrics (e.g., cosine similarity) for the recommendation engine.
